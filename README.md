## ðŸ¤” Why am I not here?

One of the reasons might be that you dont have your country in your `location` part of your GitHub profile. Another might be that the list might not be updated to the latest time, to update it, look futher down this document. Please note that due to GitHub limitations; I can only get the first 995 most followed users of a certain place; if you dont have enough followers; you can always run the script but change the country paramater to a city or area, so there will be less results.

## ðŸ‘½ I dont have enough followers, how can I fix this?

You can do the same steps for adding a country; but just leaving the script to run for a longer time; or you can create a issue, I will update the list for you. If there are 995 entires; you would have to run the script; but intead of a country, put a city or area.

## ðŸš¨ How do I update one of the lists?

You can follow the steps to add a new country; it is simple to run the script, and push your changes. You can always open a issue and I will update it for you.

## ðŸ“• How do I add my country/area?

You can either follow the steps below to add it yourself; or just open a Issue, I will get that country up in a few hours!

Do it yourself;

- Fork this repo.
- Clone it locally.
- Edit `main.js`; change the country (make sure its all lower case, change spaces with + character), also make sure its a array;
- Change the `seconds_to_grab_data` variable in `main.js` with how many seconds you would like to grab data for; you can see the comments in that line to get an idea of how many minutes you want to set this to.
- CREATE THE FILE FIRST!!! You will lose the data you got if you dont create the file first. The file must be named the same as the `country` variable in `main.js`. Example `output/country.md`.
- Create a access token.
- Run the script with the access token as a command line option; Example; `node main.js ghp_9uhjpIgozqmbuM5M1b***********`, you can also add another command line option; time to run the script for (in seconds); Example: `node main.js ghp_9uhjpIgozqmbuM5M1b*********** 600`.
- Wait until the script finishes, you will see the names and how many followers you are on right now in the command line.
- Push the changes to GitHub, open a PR.
